        <p class = "text">You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. 
        Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within
         range must make a Charisma saving throw a creature can choose to fail this saving 
         throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following 
         two effects. You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened.<br><br>
          When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not 
          expired in the meantime. Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures 
          of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked 
          or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, 
          the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.</p>
